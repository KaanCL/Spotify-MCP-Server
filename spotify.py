# üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes:
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - All functions return either a dict or a list of dicts for easy JSON serialization.
# - Error handling is consistent; always check for an "error" key in the response.
# - For advanced use, consider adding logging or metrics here.
# - Enum types and utility functions are used for maintainability and clarity.
# - This module is designed to be imported and used by a web server or other backend
#   service that needs to interact with the Spotify API on behalf of a user.
