# the Spotify API via the 'spotify' module and return results as dictionaries
# for seamless JSON serialization and API responses.

# =============================================================================
# üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - All MCP tools are designed to return Python dictionaries for easy JSON
#   serialization and integration with web APIs or front-end clients.
# - To extend functionality, simply add new @mcp.tool() functions following
#   the same pattern as above.
# - For debugging or logging, you can print or log responses within each tool.
# - Type hints and detailed docstrings are provided for all tools to enhance
#   code clarity, maintainability, and discoverability (especially in IDEs).
# - Ensure that the 'spotify' module implements the required API interactions.
# - For authentication and authorization, make sure the Spotify API credentials
#   are properly configured in your environment.
